# Meal Snap: Satisfy Your Hunger with AI

**Decoded: Discovering Culinary Creativity**

Meal Snap is a groundbreaking web application designed to solve the all-too-common problem of staring into your fridge and not knowing what to eat. Whether you're too busy to plan meals or simply seeking culinary inspiration, Meal Snap leverages cutting-edge machine learning to transform your daily meal planning into an engaging, futuristic experience.

## Project Overview

Meal Snap uses advanced computer vision and machine learning to scan your fridge's contents and generate personalized recipe suggestions. The app employs a YOLO v12 model for precise object detection and classification, enabling it to recognize a variety of food items. Additionally, a large language model (LLM) converts your natural language inputs like "I want Mexican, I'm vegan" into searchable tags, linking you to a curated recipe database.

Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel, Meal Snap is engineered for performance, scalability, and a smooth user experience.

## The Challenge

In today's fast-paced world, many of us face the dilemma of being hungry without a clear idea of what to cook. Uncertainty about what's in your fridge, coupled with evolving dietary preferences, makes meal planning a significant challenge. Our hackathon challenge was to develop an innovative solution that not only identifies available ingredients but also inspires you with creative, delicious recipes.

## Objectives

- **Identify Fridge Contents:**  
  Utilize computer vision techniques (CNN & YOLO v12) to accurately detect and classify food items from a simple photo of your fridge.

- **Generate Recipe Suggestions:**  
  Employ a large language model to transform natural language queries into actionable tags for retrieving relevant recipes from our database.

- **Seamless User Experience:**  
  Build a responsive, user-friendly web app using Next.js and deploy it via Vercel to ensure high availability and performance.

- **Pave the Way for Future Culinary Innovations:**  
  Integrate machine learning and natural language processing to set the stage for smarter, more context-aware cooking assistance.

## Machine Learning and Future Vision

Meal Snap is a prime example of how machine learning can revolutionize everyday tasks. By training a YOLO v12 model, we achieved high-accuracy object detection, although the initial training phase required significant fine-tuning to overcome inaccuracies. Combining this with the power of a large language model has enabled us to offer truly personalized recipe recommendations.

This fusion of computer vision and NLP not only solves a practical problem but also showcases the potential for future innovations in culinary technology.

## Challenges Faced

- **Recipe Accuracy:**  
  Early iterations of our recipe-matching algorithm were inconsistent, prompting us to refine our approach through iterative improvements.

- **Model Training:**  
  Training the YOLO v12 model presented challenges, particularly with initial inaccuracies that required extensive data preprocessing and tuning.

- **Real-Time Processing:**  
  Ensuring the application could process images quickly and deliver accurate results necessitated careful pipeline optimization.

- **Dataset Diversity:**  
  Managing a varied dataset of food items under different conditions proved complex but essential for robust model performance.

## Deliverables

- **Web Application:**  
  A fully functional, intuitive web app that scans fridge contents and provides tailored recipe suggestions.

- **Machine Learning Pipeline:**  
  An integrated system combining YOLO v12 for object detection and a large language model for processing natural language inputs.
